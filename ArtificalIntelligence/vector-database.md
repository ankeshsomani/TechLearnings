# Vector Databases
A vector database is a specific kind of database that saves information in the form of multi-dimensional vectors representing certain characteristics or qualities.
The primary benefit of a vector database is its ability to swiftly and precisely locate and retrieve data according to their vector proximity or resemblance

Unstructured data, such as text, images, and audio, lacks a predefined format, posing challenges for traditional databases. To leverage this data in artificial intelligence and machine learning applications, it's transformed into numerical representations using embeddings.

Embedding is like giving each item, whether it's a word, image, or something else, a unique code that captures its meaning or essence. This code helps computers understand and compare these items in a more efficient and meaningful way. Think of it as turning a complicated book into a short summary that still captures the main points.
This embedding process is typically achieved using a special kind of neural network designed for the task. For example, word embeddings convert words into vectors in such a way that words with similar meanings are closer in the vector space.
This transformation allows algorithms to understand relationships and similarities between items.
Essentially, embeddings serve as a bridge, converting non-numeric data into a form that machine learning models can work with, enabling them to discern patterns and relationships in the data more effectively.
